About Python Language Translation Project
Our objective is to create a Language Translator which would help us translate a word, sentence or even a paragraph to another language. We will try to incorporate as many languages as possible. We will be using Tkinter Module to build our GUI for the project and googletrans library to present us with a number of languages that are a part of it. Also, we will use the TextBlob library for processing textual data.

Project Prerequisites :
This project requires a basic understanding of python and the Tkinter module.
To proceed with the project one needs to install the Tkinter Module, Textblob, and Googletrans library using the following commands.
pip install tk
pip install -U textblob
pip install googletrans

Project Structure :
Let us discuss the steps we will be taking to proceed with the Python Language Translation project.
1.Importing the required modules and libraries.
2.Adding and importing the languages to the project.
3.Creating the window.
4 Adding frame, button, text area, and language drop-down to the window.
5 Creating a Translate() function.
6 Call the main command to run the window.
